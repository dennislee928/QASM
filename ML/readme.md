# Quantum Machine Learning Project

This repository demonstrates the use of quantum computing for machine learning tasks. The project combines classical Python programming with quantum circuits written in QASM (Quantum Assembly Language).

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- **`embeded_with_python.py`**: A Python script that integrates quantum operations with classical programming. It showcases how quantum machine learning models can be embedded into Python workflows.
- **`basic_ML.qasm`**: A QASM file defining a basic quantum machine learning circuit.
- **`trained_neural_network.qasm`**: A QASM file representing a trained quantum neural network.
- **`readme.md`**: Documentation for the project (this file).

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Quantum computing tools such as:
  - IBM Qiskit (for simulating and running quantum circuits)
  - A QASM-compatible quantum simulator or hardware
- Additional Python dependencies, which can be installed using:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## How to Use

### 1. Running the Quantum Circuits

- Use a QASM simulator or quantum hardware to execute the `.qasm` files.
- Load the `basic_ML.qasm` or `trained_neural_network.qasm` into your quantum environment to simulate the circuits.

### 2. Embedding with Python

- Run the `embeded_with_python.py` script to see how quantum operations integrate with classical machine learning workflows.

  ```bash
  python embeded_with_python.py
  ```

### 3. Customization

- Modify the `.qasm` files to explore different quantum machine learning algorithms.
- Enhance the Python script to include data preprocessing, result analysis, or more complex workflows.

## Files Overview
