This example demonstrates:

A 3-qubit system where:

2 qubits encode feature data

1 qubit serves as the classification output

Basic ML components:

Data encoding using rotation gates (rx, ry)

Feature interaction using CNOT gates

Classification using Hadamard and CNOT gates

Key quantum ML concepts:

Quantum superposition (using h gate)

Entanglement (using cx gates)

Measurement for classical output

This is a simplified example meant for learning purposes. In practice, quantum machine learning would typically involve:

More qubits for handling complex data

More sophisticated encoding schemes

Additional quantum operations for the classification process

Multiple iterations/measurements for training

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this quantum ML circuit in more detail?
